# jme-navmesh-ai
This project was born with the aim of creating a bridge API between the recast4j library and jMonkeyEngine.

This project optimizes and adds new tools and features to the original project [jme3-recast4j](https://github.com/MeFisto94/jme3-recast4j-demo/wiki)

üîî If you found this project useful, please let me know by leaving a like to motivate me to improve it. Thanks.

### Features
- _NavMeshAgent_ that allows you to move the character in the Scene using the NavMesh.
- _NavMeshQueryFilter_ - Specifies which areas to consider when searching the NavMesh.
- _NavMeshTools_ - Use the NavMesh class to perform spatial queries such as pathfinding and walkability tests.
- _NavMeshBuildMarkup_ allows you to control how certain objects are treated during the NavMesh build process, specifically when collecting sources for building.
- _NavMeshBuildSettings_ allows you to specify a collection of settings which describe the dimensions and limitations of a particular agent type.
- _IORecast_ to export **NavMesh** in _.obj_ format.
- _Graphic Editor_ to modify the NavMesh generation parameters at Runtime.
